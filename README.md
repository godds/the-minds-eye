# The Mind's Eye: How We Perceive Data

Over the last couple of centuries, data visualisation has developed to the point where it is in everyday use across all walks of life. Data visualisation is generally recognised as an effective tool for both storytelling and analysis, overcoming most language and educational barriers. But why is this the case?

Scientific research is beginning to provide an insight into the neurological and psychological processes that underpin the principles of data visualisation. This talk will show how the science of visual perception explains why the principles of data visualisation are so effective, and how an understanding of the science behind best practice can improve the design of your visualisations.
